Improving the usability of Python programs
==========================================

Logging
-------

It can be useful  to print out either a message or the  value of some variable,
etc.,  while  your  code is  running.  This  is  quite  common and  is  usually
accomplished with a simple call to the ``print`` function.

.. code-block:: python

    x = 1.234
    print("The value of x is {0:0.4f}.".format(x))

.. code-block:: none

    The value of x is 1.2340.

Doing this is a  good idea to keep track of milestones in  your code. That way,
both when you  are developing your code  but also when other  users are running
the code, they can be notified of an event, progress, or value.

Printing a message is also useful for  notifying the user when something is not
going as expected. These are all different *levels* of messaging.

*Logging* is  simply engaging in this  behavior of printing out  messages, with
the added  feature that you include  meta data (e.g., a  timestamp, the message
category) with the message, as well as a filter where only messages with a high
enough level of criticality are actually allowed to be printed.


Logging Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The general  idea is  that there are  multiple levels of  messages that  can be
printed. Typically these include:

1. DEBUG    - diagnostic purposes.
2. INFO     - basic information (most common).
3. WARNING  - indicating non-normal behavior.
4. ERROR    - error (the operation cannot continue).
5. CRITICAL - error (the program cannot continue).

During the initialization portion of your  code, you would configure a *logger*
object with a  format, where to print messages (e.g.,  console, file, or both),
and what level to use by default.  Usually, you would set the default log level
to ``INFO`` and the debugging messages  used for diagnostics would not actually
be printed. Then, allow the user to override this with a `command line argument
<#command-line-arguments>`_ (e.g., ``--debug``).


Example Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python has a `logging <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`_ module
as part of the  standard library. It is very comprehensive  and allows the user
to heavily customize many parts of the behavior. It is pretty strait forward to 
implement your own logging functionality; unless you're doing something special 
why not use the standard library?

.. code-block:: python

    import logging

    log = logging.getLogger("my_app")
    handler = logging.StreamHandler()

    formatter = logging.Formatter("%(levelname)s %(asctime)s %(name)s - %(message)s")
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)

    log.addHandler(handler)
    log.setLevel(logging.INFO)

Then, somewhere in the code:

.. code-block:: python

    log.debug("report on some variable")
    log.info("notification of milestone")
    log.warn("non-standard behavior")
    log.error("unrecoverable issue")
    log.critical("panic!")

.. code-block:: none

    INFO 2018-07-24 09:41:56,683 ProjectName - notification of milestone
    WARNING 2018-07-24 09:41:56,835 ProjectName - non-standard behavior
    ERROR 2018-07-24 09:41:57,103 ProjectName - unrecoverable issue
    CRITICAL 2018-07-24 09:41:57,103 ProjectName - panic!

Notice that the debug  message was not printed. This is because  we set the log
level to  ``INFO``. Only  messages with  a level  equal to  or higher  then the
assigned level will make it passed the filter.



Command Line Arguments
----------------------

In addition to packaging your code in  a way that other users or projects can
import for use in their code, often it makes sense to also make elements of the
code executable from  the  command line as stand alone scripts. Python has
everything you need to do this built right in.

As with logging, there are several python packages available that
handle command line argument parsing for you, including a robust
implementation provided right in the standard library using `argparse
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html>`_.

The *argparse*  module, as  well as  the others, rely  on a  universally excepted
convention for how  command line arguments should be structured. Nearly all of
the standard utilities on  Unix/Linux  systems  use  this same syntax.  This
convention covers both the command line argument syntax as well as the structure
of *usage*  statements that your  script prints  out (e.g., when  supplying the
``--help`` option). The *argparse* module actually takes care of all  of this
for you.

Unix Convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is  a fair bit  of complexity to  the convention surrounding  the *usage*
statements, but the argument syntax is fairly simple.

*Positional arguments* are those that don't  have names. These are usually file
paths in the  context of analysis scripts. *Optional arguments*  are those that
have defaults and may or may not accept a value.

Optional arguments  can be  specified with  *short form*  or *long  form* names
(usually both). The short  form names are a single letter  preceded by a single
dash (e.g.,  ``-a``). Short  form options  that don't take  an argument  can be
stacked (e.g., ``-abc``).  Long form arguments are whole words  and preceded by
two dashes (e.g., ``--debug``). Long form arguments that are multiple words are
usually joined with dashes (e.g., ``--output-directory``).

There is more, but these are the basics.


Simple Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best (most robust and cross-platform) way of providing a stand along script
with your package is to let your `setup.py` file handle it. Doing the following
will create the proper  executable on both Windows and Unix  systems and put it
in a place that is readily callable (i.e., on the user's `PATH`).

.. code-block:: python

    # setup.py

    # use "entry_points" to point to function and setuptools
    # will create executables on your behalf.
    setup(
    # ...
        # syntax: "{name}={package}.{module}:{function}"
        # "{name}" will be on your PATH in the same "/bin/"
        # alongside python/pip executables.
        entry_points = {"console_scripts": [
            "do_science=my_package.do_science:main",
        ]},
    # ...
    )

This says  that I  have a file,  ``my_package/do_science.py``, with  a function
called ``main`` that  when called does the  thing I want the script  to do. The
function  won't be  given any  arguments,  but we  can  get what  we need  from
``sys.argv``. This has the effect of  creating an executable we can invoke with
the name ``do_science`` that behaves equivalent to the following.

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    from my_package.do_science import main
    sys.exit(main())

With this  in mind, your  function can and  should return integer  values which
will  be  used  as the  exit  status  of  the  command. This  is  another  Unix
convention;  returning  zero  is  for  success,  returning  a  non-zero  status
indicates some specific error has occurred.

The following shows a basic usage of ``argparse`` and how to define your "main"
function.

.. code-block:: python

    # do_science.py
    # script for doing cool science things

    import argparse

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog="do_science",
                                     description="do cool science thing")

    # positional argument
    parser.add_argument("input_file", help="path to input data file")

    # optional argument
    parser.add_argument("-d", "--debug", action="store_true",
                        help="enable debugging messages")

    def main() -> int:
        """Main entry point for `do_science`.

           Returns:
           exit_status: int
               0 if success, non-zero otherwise.
        """

        # parse_args() automatically grabs sys.argv if you don't provide them.
        opts = parser.parse_args()
        # opts is a namespace
        # opts.input_file is a string with the value from the command line
        # opts.debug is True or False (default is False w/ "store_true")
        return 0


After the package is installed, ``pip install my_package ...``, you'll be able to
call the script:

.. code-block:: none

    > do_science 
    usage: do_science [-h] [-d] input_file

.. code-block:: none

    > do_science --help
    usage: do_science [-h] [-d] input_file
    
    do cool science thing

    positional arguments:
      input_file   path to input data file
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help   show this help message and exit
      -d, --debug  enable debugging messages
